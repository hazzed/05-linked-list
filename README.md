Exported Module (Linked List):

In the linked-list.js module I am exporting the LinkedList class. The LinkedList class has a constructor with an arity of one (value) and properties: this.value = value; and this.next = null;

Functions (append, remove, find):

The append and remove functions each have the parameter 'node'. These two functions are working to either add a new node in to the linked list or to remove one.

The find function has the parameter 'value'. This function locates a value and returns it.
